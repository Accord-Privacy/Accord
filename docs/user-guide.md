## Getting Started

### Downloading the App

Download the Accord desktop app for your operating system from [accord.chat](https://accord.chat). Accord is available for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

### First-Run Setup

When you launch Accord for the first time, a setup wizard will guide you through three steps:

#### Step 1: Welcome
A brief introduction to Accord and what makes it different — your messages are end-to-end encrypted, and no personal information is required to sign up.

#### Step 2: Create Your Identity

You have two options:

- **Create a new identity** — Accord will generate a fresh cryptographic identity for you. You'll need to:
  1. Choose a **display name** (this is what other people will see).
  2. Set a **password** (at least 8 characters) to protect your identity on this device.
  3. **Save your recovery phrase** — Accord will show you a 12-word phrase. **Write this down and keep it safe!** This phrase is the only way to recover your account if you lose access to your device.

- **Recover an existing identity** — If you've used Accord before, enter your 12-word recovery phrase and set a new password to restore your identity.

#### Step 3: Connect to a Relay

A relay is the server that routes your encrypted messages. You can either:

- **Enter a relay address** directly (e.g., `wss://relay.example.com` or `relay.example.com`). The app will auto-detect the correct format.
- **Use an invite link** — If someone shared an Accord invite link with you, paste it here. The relay address and invite code will be extracted automatically.

Once connected, you're in! 🎉

## Navigating the Interface

Accord's layout will feel familiar if you've used Discord or similar apps:

### Sidebar (Left)
- **Node list** — At the top left, you'll see the Nodes (communities) you've joined. Click a Node's icon to switch to it.
- **Channel list** — Below the Node name, channels are organized into **categories** (collapsible groups). Text channels are marked with a **#** symbol, and voice channels have a **🔊** speaker icon.
- **Your profile** — At the bottom of the sidebar, you'll see your display name, status, and controls for mute/deafen (when in a voice channel).

### Main Content (Center)
- **Channel header** — Shows the current channel name and topic.
- **Message area** — Where conversations happen. Messages appear in chronological order.
- **Message input** — At the bottom, type your messages here.

### Member List (Right)
- Shows everyone in the current Node, organized by their roles.
- **Online indicators** — Green dot means online, yellow means away, red means busy, and grey means offline.
- Click a member's name to view their profile card.

## Messaging

### Sending Messages
Type your message in the input box at the bottom and press **Enter** to send. Press **Shift + Enter** to add a new line without sending.

### Editing Messages
To edit a message you've sent, hover over it and click the **pencil icon** (✏️), or right-click and select **Edit**. Make your changes, then press **Enter** to save or **Escape** to cancel.

### Deleting Messages
Hover over a message you've sent and click the **trash icon** (🗑️), or right-click and select **Delete**. You'll be asked to confirm before the message is removed.

### Markdown Formatting
Accord supports markdown to style your messages:

| Syntax | Result |
|---|---|
| `**bold**` | **bold** |
| `*italic*` | *italic* |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
| `` `inline code` `` | `inline code` |
| ` ```code block``` ` | Code block (multi-line) |
| `> quote` | Block quote |
| `[link text](url)` | Clickable link |

### File Uploads
You can share files in two ways:
- **Click the attachment button** (📎) next to the message input to browse and select files.
- **Drag and drop** files directly into the chat window.

Selected files appear as previews below the message input before you send. You can remove a staged file by clicking the ✕ on its preview.

### Link Previews
When you share a URL, Accord will automatically generate a preview showing the page title and description (when available).

---

## Privacy & Security

### End-to-End Encryption
All messages and files in Accord are **end-to-end encrypted**. This means:
- Your messages are encrypted on your device before they leave.
- The relay server only sees encrypted data — it **cannot** read your messages.
- Only the intended recipients can decrypt and read them.

Accord uses industry-standard cryptography (the same foundations as the Signal protocol) to protect your conversations.

### Disappearing Messages
Node owners can set messages to auto-delete after a chosen time — a node-wide default or a per-channel override. Turning it on also wipes messages already older than the limit. The relay only ever sees an opaque expiry timestamp; the policy itself is encrypted and shared privately among members. When enabled, messages show a small clock badge.

### Read-Gated Messages
When composing, click the **clock button** in the message bar to attach retention to a single message:
- **Vanish after a time** — a plain timer.
- **Vanish after seen** — pick specific people and/or roles; the timer doesn't start until *they* have opened it, so the message stays for anyone who hasn't read it yet. Each reader's own copy disappears after they read it. (Deletion is honored by their app — like any disappearing message, it isn't a hard guarantee against a modified client.)

### Screenshot Protection
A node or channel can ask your operating system to exclude the Accord window from screen capture. This is reliable on **Windows and macOS**; on **Linux** it's best-effort (many Wayland compositors ignore it), and Accord tells you so rather than implying a guarantee.

### Panic Wipe
In **Settings → Privacy** (danger zone), **Panic Wipe** immediately destroys all local identity, keys, and data on this device and reloads the app to a clean state. Keep your 12-word recovery phrase somewhere safe if you ever want the account back.

### Duress Password
You can configure a **duress password** distinct from your real one. Entering the duress password at login **wipes your real identity and data** and opens an empty, offline decoy account — with no forensic trace that a second (real) account ever existed. Use it if you may be compelled to unlock the app.

### Blocking Users
To block a user, open their profile card and click **Block**. Blocked users won't be able to send you direct messages. You can manage your blocked users list in **Settings → Privacy**.

### Identity Export & Import
Your identity is tied to a **12-word recovery phrase** (shown when you first created your account). To move your identity to a new device:

1. On your new device, choose **Recover an existing identity** during setup.
2. Enter your 12-word recovery phrase.
3. Set a new password for the new device.

You can also use **QR code sync** — go to **Settings → Account** to generate a QR code that another device can scan to import your identity.

### Privacy Controls
In **Settings → Privacy**, you can control:
- **Read receipts** — Whether others can see when you've read their messages.
- **Typing indicators** — Whether others can see when you're typing.

### Choosing Who to Trust
Accord performs **no central moderation** — because the relay can't read your messages, no platform admin is filtering content or refereeing communities. Each **node owner** is responsible for their own space.

What this means for you:
- If a node isn't what you expected, **leave it.**
- For a space you trust, **create your own node and invite only people you know.**
- Report problems to the **node's** owners/moderators — there is no "Accord" to appeal to, by design.
- **Parents:** you are responsible for what your children see and do on Accord, the same as with a web browser. There is no platform-side content filter.

See [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md) for the full philosophy.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
If you're having trouble connecting to a relay:
1. **Check the relay address** — Make sure it's entered correctly in your settings. Go to **Settings → Advanced** to view or change it.
2. **Check your internet connection** — Ensure you have a stable network connection.
3. **Try reconnecting** — The app will automatically attempt to reconnect, but you can also restart Accord.
4. **Firewall or VPN** — Some networks may block WebSocket connections. Try a different network if possible.

### Voice Not Working
- Make sure your browser/OS has granted microphone permissions to Accord.
- Check **Settings → Voice** to ensure the correct input and output devices are selected.
- Try toggling mute on and off.

### Messages Not Decrypting
If you see encrypted/garbled messages:
- This can happen if your encryption keys are out of sync. Try leaving and rejoining the Node.
- Make sure you're using the same identity (recovery phrase) as when the messages were sent to you.

### Clearing Local Data
If Accord is behaving unexpectedly, clearing local data can help:
1. Go to **Settings → Advanced**.
2. Look for the option to clear local storage or reset the app.
3. **Warning:** This will log you out and remove locally stored data. Make sure you have your 12-word recovery phrase saved before doing this!

### Getting Help
If none of the above resolves your issue, visit the Accord community or check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Accord-Privacy/Accord) for known issues and support.
