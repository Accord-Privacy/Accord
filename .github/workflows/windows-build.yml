            ### Download & Install
            1. Download `Accord_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (NSIS installer, recommended)
            2. Run the installer — Windows may show a SmartScreen warning, click "More info" → "Run anyway"
            3. Launch Accord from the Start Menu

            ### Known Issues
            - Windows SmartScreen warning (unsigned beta build)
            - This is a beta — expect rough edges

            ### Feedback
            Report issues or design feedback to Gage directly or open a GitHub issue.
