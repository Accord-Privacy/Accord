    # glib 0.18.5: Unsoundness in VariantStrIter (NULL pointer deref)
    # Patched in glib 0.20+ which requires GTK4. Tauri 2.x uses GTK3 (glib 0.18).
    # Tauri GTK4 migration is in progress: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/14684
    # Targeted for Tauri 3.0. We will upgrade immediately when available.
    # Risk: Memory unsoundness in VariantStrIter — we don't directly use this API,
    # but it exists in compiled code via Tauri's GTK3 dependency chain.
    # TRACKING: Check monthly for Tauri 3.0 release with GTK4 support.
